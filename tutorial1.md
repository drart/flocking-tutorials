Getting Started

This tutorial will show you how to take the examples from the Flocking Playground and run them on your own computer, without the need for an internet connection. 

Step 1: Make sure the examples work for you

Go to the Flocking Playground and run the examples: https://flockingjs.org/demos/playground/

Step: 2: Copy the sine example and work it into a simple HTML page

Open up your favourite text editor and type out a basic webpage. Put the example in a script tag. Open it up in a web browser. If you are lucky this won't work. 

Step 3: Add the Flocking.js library to your sketch

There are many ways to add Flocking.js to your project. We are going to start with the simplest method of downloading the file and having it in the same folder as our html file and then using the script tag to link it into our page. 

You can get a copy of Flocking.js by going to the github page and looking in the dist/ folder for various builds of the Flocking.js library.
